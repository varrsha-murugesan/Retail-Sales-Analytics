**Real-Time Retail Sales Analytics Pipeline**

**Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to evaluate promotion effectiveness and optimize pricing strategies. Since real-world retail data was not publicly available, a synthetic dataset was generated using Databricks Community Edition to simulate realistic transaction patterns, competitor pricing, and consumer demand.The pipeline leverages PySpark and Delta Lake for scalable data processing and Power BI for interactive visualization, enabling data-driven business insights.

**Business Problem**
-> Retail companies often struggle to determine:
-> How discounts impact revenue
-> Optimal pricing strategies
-> Customer purchasing patterns
-> Profitability across categories
This project builds an analytics pipeline to evaluate price elasticity and promotion effectiveness.

**Tech Stack**
->Python
->Pandas
->NumPy
->Apache Spark / PySpark
->Delta Lake
->Databricks Community Edition
->Power BI
->CSV-based data storage

**Data Generation**
To simulate real-world retail scenarios, synthetic transactional data was generated in Databricks Community Edition, incorporating:
-> Consumer demand patterns
-> Pricing variations
-> Discount strategies
-> Competitor price influence
-> Regional purchasing behavior
This approach allowed controlled experimentation and realistic analytics modeling.

**Corrected Workflow Section
Project Workflow**
-> Generated synthetic retail transaction data using Databricks Community Edition
-> Exported processed data into CSV format
-> Performed data cleaning and transformations using PySpark
-> Built Delta tables for structured data handling
-> Conducted price elasticity analysis
-> Visualized insights using Power BI
